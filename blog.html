                <p class="title">Does It Matter to Use Relative Size</p>
                <article>
                    <p class="p1">
                        Nowdays as browsers features are advanced and matured, we had to consider how to work with those new features when designing and developing our sites. These featueres allowed us to create a robust designs. 
                        One example of this feature is browser zooming, which allowed us users to zoom everything on the page by scaling up and down proportionally depending on our preferences. But as browsers handle page zoom for us, 
                        there is a difference in how the the UI appears when the page is zoomed depending on the weather the default browser size has been adjested as well. Here is why it is usefull to use relative css units and unitless 
                        values like (%, em, rem) more consistently, in our css to meet the needs of ever-changing viewport sizes. Since giving units in this way able us to zoom the viewport without loss of the content and able us to resize text without
                        being forced to scroll both horizontally and vertically to read the content, I prefer relative sizing method.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="p1">
                        The other main thing we want when we are designing a website is its flexibility, like how the site response with the browsers scale changing and still having maximum readability.
                        So I say using relative size does matter in order to make our site more attractive and user friendly.Such as (%, em, rem) beacause this units provide flexibility and the ability to scale up and down,
                        Instead of being stuck with fixed size. This units are scalable units which are translated by the browser into pixel values,in this case they can be translated in the browser as anything from the 16px which is default browser width to any other value depending on the font size on the design.
                        Which makes them best for responsive design.  On the other hand if we are using px unit, it will stay explicitly fixed in size bacause the browser displays it exactly as it is.

                <p class="title">How Does Browser Interpreate</p>
                <article>
                    <p class="p3">
                        A web page isn’t a single entity that is downloaded and displayed on screen one pixel at a time. Instead it is essentially a series of instructions written in various types of code HTML, CSS and others — that tell the browser what to do and where and how to do it. Each browser
                        uses a rendering engine, sometimes also referred to as a layout engine, to take the content and styling information contained within the code, and display it on screen in its fully formatted form. But to do this the browser reads the raw byte of data, and not the actual characters of code we have 
                        written and inorder to understand it the browser works with Document Object model(DOM). Then the byte data is converted to characters which is further parsed into something called tokens.
                        
                         
                    </p>
                    <p class="p3">
                        Depending on how large the HTML file is, the DOM construction process may take some time. No matter how small, it does take some time (no matter how minute), regardless of the file size. Nodes are also formed, and, finally, a tree structure is formed.  There’s also a CSS tree structure called the CSS Object Model (CSSOM).
                        The DOM and CSSOM tree structures are two independent structures. The DOM contains all the information about the page’s HTML element’s relationships, while the CSSOM contains information on how the elements are styled.
                        After all this, the browser now combines the DOM and CSSOM trees into something called a render tree.
                        This is how the browser interpreate the bytes and turning them into rendered pixels on the screen.        
                    </p>
                    <p class="p3">
                        In Simple term, the devicePixelRatio of Window interface returns the ratio of the resolution in physical pixels to the resolution in CSS pixels for the current display device. This value could also be interpreted as the ratio of pixel sizes: the size of one CSS pixel to the size of one physical pixel. In simpler terms, this tells the browser how many of the screen's actual pixels should be used to draw a single CSS pixel.
                    </p>
                    <label for="" class="calc">  Pixel value calculated using that percentage: </label>
                    <p class="percent">
                       100% = 16px <br>
                       X    = 200px
                    </p>

                <p class="title">CSS3 Changes</p>
                <article>
                    <p class="p2">
                        CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2. It brings a lot of new features and additions, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts.
                    </p>
                        <label for="">Compatibility</label>
                    <p class="p2">
                        CSS3 is backword compatible with CSS2. It will not make any code written in CSS2 as invalid. it makes the look and feel of a webpage even better. They load faster and the time required to build a page is even less.   
                    </p>
                        <label for="">Multiple Background Images</label>
                    <p class="p2">
                        In CSS3, there’s no need to include an element for every background image; it provides us with the ability to add more than one background image to any element, even to pseudo-elements.
                    </p>
                        <label for="">Box Sizing</label>
                    <p class="p2">
                        Box-sizing allows developers to get the sizing of elements right without having to subtract dimensions for padding and borders. With the box-sizing property, the padding and border are included in the height and width.
                    </p>
                        <label for="">Colors</label>
                    <p class="p2">
                        CSS3 brings with it support for some new ways of describing colours. The most notable change with these new color types is the ability to declare semitransparent colors, this due to the options:  HSL, HSLA, and RGBA. 
                        RGBA                  
                    </p>
                    <p class="p2">
                       <em>RGBA </em>works just like RGB, except that it adds a fourth value: alpha, the opacity level or alpha transparency level. The first three values still represent red, green, and blue. For the alpha value, 1 means fully opaque, 0 is fully transparent, and 0.5 is 50% opaque. You can use any number between 0 and 1 inclusively. <br>
                       <em>HSL</em>  stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. With HSL you can tweak either just the saturation or the lightness while keeping the same base hue. <br>
                       <em>Opacity</em>  sets the opaqueness of the element on which it’s declared, similar to alpha.

                    </p>
                        <label for="">Create 2D and 3D transformations, animations, and transitions</label>
                    <p class="p2">
                        These effects allow elements on a page to rotate, grow, shrink, flip, or translate into a different color. For the first time, elements created in CSS can move on screen without requiring any JavaScript or Flash code. With transitions, an element can seamlessly change size and color. You can set a duration for a transition, e.g. creating a button that slowly expands and changes color when you mouse over it.
                    </p>
                        <label for="">Box Sizing</label>
                    <p class="p2">
                        Box-sizing allows developers to get the sizing of elements right without having to subtract dimensions for padding and borders. With the box-sizing property, the padding and border are included in the height and width.
                    </p>
                        <label for="">Border-Radius</label>
                    <p class="p2">
                        The border-radius property lets you create rounded corners without the need for images or additional markup. If we had wanted different-sized corners, we could declare up to four unique values.
                    </p>
                        <label for="">Box Shadow</label>
                    <p class="p2">
                        It provides the ability to add drop shadows to elements using the box-shadow property. This property lets you specify the color, height, width, blur, and offset of one or multiple inner and/or outer drop shadows on your elements.
                    </p>
                        <label for="">Linear Gradient</label>
                    <p class="p2">
                        The linear-gradient() function sets a linear gradient as the background image.
                        To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.
                     </p>
                        <label for="">Radial Gradient</label>
                    <p class="p2">
                        Radial gradients are circular or elliptical gradients. Rather than proceeding along a straight axis, colors blend out from a starting point in all directions.
                    </p>
                        <label for="">Selectors</label>
                    <p class="p2">
                        Developers can edit elements by name, class, type, attribute, and more.
                    </p>
                        <label for="">Text Shadow</label>
                    <p class="p2">
                        Text-shadow adds shadows to individual characters in text nodes.
                    </p>
