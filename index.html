            <h1>Abenezer Fekadu</h1>
            <h3>Student, Addis Ababa Univeristy</h3>
            <p>Hello, every one my name is Abenezer Fekadu and i was born in a small 
                town called Gursum, from my mother Azalech Ababa and my father Fekadu Tefera. so 
                when I was born I wasn't alone, i had a twin brother whose name Natnael Fekadu. 
                when I was on the age of 5 me and my brother started school, but then we didnt 
                know what it was. After learning in KG for two years my family moved on to another
                town called babile, so we have to move too. Here we continued our school and made it 
                to 1st class. when I lived in babile I used to have a lot of friends, we used to play 
                a lot, even watched movies together. 
                
                The friendship that started there still continues until today. Unitl we finished primaryschool
                it was an awesome adventure for me, I had alot of fun. After that since I've grown up,
                there were some challenges but thanks to my family, I never got lost. My fmaily were supporting 
                me to study hard so I could have a bright future and that is what I did now I am Learning in 
               Addis Ababa unviversity which is the best in Ethiopia. And my brother is also with me here following his dream. In 
                short, this is a taste of my life story.
